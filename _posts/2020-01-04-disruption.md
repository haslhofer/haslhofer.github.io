Disruption

If in the age of AI data is the new oil, then having lots of well-labelled data is clearly a competitive advantage. But if new models such as BERT can essentially create highly valuable embeddings based on widely available data in an unsupervised fashion (and then customize these models with relatively low volumes of domain specific training data), then this changes those dynamics dramatically. If you can hold back these models and offer them as a service, you might skim off enough value to justify a business, assuming the underlying training data is free and widely available (i.e. "free" on the internet).

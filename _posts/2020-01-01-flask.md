Trying to deploy python service to azure

Instructions:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-python?toc=%2Fpython%2Fazure%2FTOC.json&tabs=bash


# Install VS requirements
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads

# Create python environment

py -3 -m venv env
env\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
SET FLASK_APP=application.py
flask run

# Login to Azure portal and deploy Hello World app

az login
az webapp up --sku F1 -n pybert -l westus2

# Figure out dependencies the project has (generate requirements.txt

https://www.idiotinside.com/2015/05/10/python-auto-generate-requirements-txt/ 

$ pip install pipreqs
$ pipreqs /path/to/project


Problem for sentence_transformer: can't find torch >1.0.1
But other project has torch 1.1.0
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch>=1.0.1 (from sentence_transformers==0.2.5) (from versions: 0.1.2, 0.1.2.post1, 0.1.2.post2)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch>=1.0.1 (from sentence_transformers==0.2.5)

# manually install torch, but need proper requirements.txt
pip install torch==1.4.0+cpu torchvision==0.5.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

Change requirements.txt to ensure we look in the right place for torch
--find-links https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
torch==1.4.0+cpu

# First snow! 

I took this picture walking in our front yard and it seemed like such a beautiful composition of light from the sun, warm light from the houses around me and the stark contrast of these. Right before school I walked outside and I saw that it snowed!! Is was so pretty and I thought I must take a photo. The photo turned out much prettier and cooler than I thought. I hope you like it too.

# Fritzy with Shopping bags!!!!

This photo is one of my favorite photos of Fritzy! He was laying on some shopping bags and I thought it would be a cute picture of him so i took it! My favorite part of this picture was Fritzy's moustache. I think the colors are so vibrant and they look very good.🐶🐶🐶

# Good mornin' Fritzy

Good morning Fritzy! How did you sleep? This is a photo of Fritzy in the morning right after he woke up! He was walking down the stairs and I took the picture right in time when he was yawning! Its a little blurry but I hope you still like it ╰(*°▽°*)╯

# King of the bed!!!

Fritzy really likes this blanket! Every night he sleeps on it and he absolutely l💖ves it. I thought it looked funny but very kingly in Fritzy's perspective! I also thought that the blanket matched him in a way because he is black but has a tint of brown to him! I also really like this photo because he is looking straight at the camera in a very serious way! 💙

# I made a dessert 🧁

I made this dessert! It was a microwavable strawberry shortcake but i did my own twist to it! Instead of putting it in the microwave, I baked it in the oven and when i was done, i made a heart shaped hole and filled it with chocolate syrup and did a drizzle! It was very tasty! 😋

# Hola Mino I am here

I took this picture thinking that you could see his whole body and his head! This picture took a turn for the good! I think this picture is really funny and cute because you can see his teeth and his mouth opend is really funny! He is kind of smiling but in a funny way!!!I also like that his moustache is very vibrant and stands out!

I photoshopped Fritzy into a swimming pool because we put him in a swimsuit!

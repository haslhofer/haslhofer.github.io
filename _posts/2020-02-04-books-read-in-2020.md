**Chris Fussell, C. W. Goodyear: One Mission: How Leaders Build a Team of Teams**

There are benefits to driving 700 miles in a day - a full audio book!
 
TL;DR - you can combine the agility of teams with the benefits of vertically oriented organizations (bureaucracy) by fostering horizontal connections, a shared narrative, and forums to facilitate these.

 
The danger of highly cohesive sub-groups & vertical organization

- Echo chambers and “inter-tribal conflicts”
- Local success does not mean Global maxima (team win, but org overall does not achieve mission)
- Vertically oriented reviews make it hard to detect horizontal misalignment

Solution: 

-  shared mission across the organization. Leaders constantly reinforce the group's unification process by sharing stories that exemplified unity.
- Shared consciousness and understanding.
- Horizontal connections. E.g. to gain the cooperation of critical partners or external stakeholders you can identify specific people to serve as liaisons.

How to get there: 

- Frequent coordination: the author uses the example of Operations & Intelligence forum which runs daily (!) and brings myriad participants together from around the globe. Participants become “boundary connectors” and are being aligned around a shared narrative.
- Author frequently talks about “Contextualization” – forums to connect and provide shared understanding
- Avoids managers as information pumps getting overloaded
- The power of being a hub in the organization (need to work on that!) – horizontal links
- Allow new team leaders to learn the informal org structure before they are allowed to act (e.g. “No fly zone” for 2 months)
	 

Talks about the importance of the environment:
- How quickly does the environment change – do the processes in the org allow quick enough response? Are the systems managers dealing with complicated or complex (need different strategies!)
- Rhythm of business needs to adapt to the speed of the changing environment

**Patty McCord: Powerful. Building a culture of Freedom and Responsibility**
---
- Minimize rules, processes, instructions
- Communicate - how do their jobs contribute to their own goals, team's mission, overall mission of the company
- Provide context - things the org is struggling with, where it's stumbling, communicate broadly daily
- Radical honesty
- Fierce debate
- Sports team metaphor, not family
- Perks don't motivate
- You are hired to do a job, if the job is not necessary any more, you should go

**Kevin Scott: Reprogramming the American Dream**
---
Thoughts about platforms:
- most powerful platforms have self-improvment feedback loops built in (they get better, increasingly faster, until they hit some sort of plateau), examples: electricity; PC; internet; AI
- Engineering those interfaces to the to the physical world tends to be the most time consuming part of applying AI to a task.


**Cal Newport: Deep Work**
---
Rules for focused success in a distracted world

- Professional work == intense focus + concentration.
- Time spent on task X intensity of focus.
- Evaluate habits and actions: structure your time to protect the attention you need for deep work (daily units, or withdraw periodically)
- 'Embrace boredom', 'quit social media' and 'drain the shallows' of your life.

**Angela Lee Duckworth - "Grit" the power of passion and perseverance** 
---
“Talent” is the measure of how fast your “skill” advances when you apply yourself to your chosen task. 
- “talent x effort = skill.” 
- “skill x effort = achievement.” 

You must persevere to build your skills - life demands nonstop effort. More grit leads to more grit.

Power of deliberate practice: “stretch” objective <-> thoughtful replication with continual “refinement”

#### Book summary. 

#### Overall usefulness: 4 stars

Key premise: Outcomes with the highest uncertainty are often the ones we care about most. So we should use tools to help us decide well. 

## Setting the context
-	Good news: Complex decisions often harbor undiscovered options
-	Bad news: Especially low-ability individuals overestimate their abilities greatly
-	Traps: 
    - People are generally unwilling to give up things they think belong to them
    - When making decisions, focusing on an anchor variable only leads to bad decisions

## How-to decide well
(1) Create the map of variables (2) predict outcomes (3) make decisions against our objectives

###	1 - Mapping
- Tools: storytelling. They don’t give us ready solutions, but allow us to practice
- To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence you should always try to make these sources independent of each other before an issue is discussed, all members of the committee should be asked to write a very brief summary of their position (groups generally focus on shared information)
- Avoid the cognitively central in-group
- Just the presence of diverse group participants makes a difference
- Introduce expert roles to get full-spectrum thinking
- Ask people for their level of certainty (allows better assessment of where things really are)
- Seek out contradictory evidence explicitly 
- Consider more alternatives – when you find yourself in a “whether-or-not” situation, you should reframe it into a “which option” question that gives you more available paths

### 2 - Predicting
- Randomized controlled trials; ensemble forecasts
- **Scenario planning**
    - One where things get better
    - One where things get worse
    - One where things get weird
    - Resist the fallacy of interpolation
    - Construct multiple stories
- **Pre-mortems** – the plan has failed. Explain why!
- **Red-teams** – devil’s advocate

### 3 - Deciding
- Tools: Bad events table of values model

### Concepts
-	Cone of uncertainty
-	Full-spectrum vs. narrow-band thinking
-	Randomized controlled trials
-	Ensemble forecasts

Other interesting observations
-	Progress of science can be measured by the speed at which we *create things to test*

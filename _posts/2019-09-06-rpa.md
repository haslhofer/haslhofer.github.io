Robotic process automation
---

**Intros about learning**

* [Reinforcement learning example](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning/ ) to teach machines tasks. 
* [More recent publication on this topic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00943v1)
* [AI plays starcraft really well](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/)
* [Learning to navigate in Cities without a Map](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/learning-to-navigate-cities-without-a-map )
* [Supplemental paper describing the network architecture (cov net + LSTM)](https://github.com/deepmind/streetlearn) 

* [IMPALA - Importance-Weighted Actor-Learner Architectures](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/impala-scalable-distributed-deeprl-dmlab-30)
* [Curiosity driven exploration: data efficient model based RL through unsupervised object discovery and curiosity driven exploration](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/COBRA-Data-Efficient-Model-Based-RL)

**(Guided) Exploration**

* Real World Graphs to [accelerate reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00664.pdf)
* [Workflow-Guided Exploration: sample-efficient RL agent for web tasks](
https://github.com/stanfordnlp/wge)
* Further interesting avenues to explore: random walk exploration vs. curiosity-driven goal-conditioned policy

**General articles about task completion**
* Micro tasks, is the way people complete tasks changing? [Microtasks and distraction, by Jaime](https://www.fastcompany.com/90401814/microsoft-is-designing-ai-powered-next-gen-tools-for-the-age-of-distraction)
* [Attach and detach from work](http://teevan.org/publications/papers/chi18-switch.pdf) 

**Concpets to explore**
* Recurrent variational auto-encoder

**Things to learn from autonomous driving
* Learning by cheating - decomposing learning into two stages (one with prvileged information, then prvilieged agent trains another agent)

Engineering Principles

# Organizational design
- Experts across the full stack needed to create a product have to be *part of the team*

# Project setup

## Dependencies
- A new product has to be dependency free, or only have dependencies that can be satisfied by providing a credit card (i.e. no people involved in getting a dependency commit)

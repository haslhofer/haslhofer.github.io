Engineering Principles - hard-won lessons 
---

# Leadership
- 3 strikes principle
    ```
    First month do what you need to do
    Second month mentoring and coaching
    Third month: it's dysfunctional, so needs to be fixed (e.g. leadership change) 
    ```


- Everything is matrixed. So you need leaders who can do product and technology
- Which metrics do we want to move? - customer or business focused
- If I don't believe your plan you don't have a plan
- Ruthlessly eliminate dysfunction
- 80% of investment needs to be in the direct service of the customer
- "What is the speed of light" of a problem
    ``` 
    What are the *actual physics*. Work back from there.
    ```
- Go plant your flag!

# Organizational design
- Fix only dysfunctional orgs (because landing a new org take 6-9 months). Be steady-handed
- Experts across the full stack needed to create a product have to be *part of the team*
- Horizontal teams have the highest dysfunction (because they are disconnected from the customer)
- L-shaped orgs (platform + customer facing scenario) keep everyone humble


- You can't have a cultural translation layer in the org (align culture at the top with culture in the middle with culture at the bottom)
    ```
    E.g. Concept of family vs. professional sports team 
    ```
- Learning has to be part of the design because probability of getting things right the first time is so low
- Measure NPS consistently

# Project setup

## Dependencies
- A new product has to be dependency free, or only have dependencies that can be satisfied by providing a credit card (i.e. no people involved in getting a dependency commit)
- Cross-geo dependencies within team ~= cross-team dependencies (i.e. hard)

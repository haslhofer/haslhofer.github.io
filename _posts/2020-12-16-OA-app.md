(using motion estimation to find the difference between frames)
There are two mainstream techniques of motion estimation: pel-recursive algorithm (PRA) and block-matching algorithm (BMA). PRAs are iterative refining of motion estimation for individual pels by gradient methods. BMAs assume that all the pels within a block has the same motion activity. BMAs estimate motion on the basis of rectangular blocks and produce one motion vector for each block. PRAs involve more computational complexity and less regularity, so they are difficult to realize in hardware. In general, BMAs are more suitable for a simple hardware realization because of their regularity and simplicity.

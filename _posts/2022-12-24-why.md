Why are my notes still scattered everywhere?
---

I have two blogs. One of them for note taking. But there's no real structure.
I have OneNote. But I struggle between personal and company notes. 
I send emails to myself. It's mostly for articles I liked and would like to keep.


# GitHub

Like
- The **safety** of a place that I know will be around in years. Github fits that bill nicely.
- From **anywhere**. Lowest common denominator - I can add something via a webpage, and know it'll get committed, safe, durable. No concept of "local"
- **Sharable** if needed 
- Markdown - simple format that forces clarity
- Ability to append / edit
- Ability to run scripts - promise of automation, or post-processing

Dislike
- No proper search
- Images are a pain
- Locked to page format (I'm not diligent enough to always find the right page to add stuff to)
- No easy share to from phone

# File system on OneDrive

Like
- "Smart docs" folder that has the best of my writing / documents from work
    - A special "place", special decoration
- Nice for 


Dislike
- Some garbage accumulates

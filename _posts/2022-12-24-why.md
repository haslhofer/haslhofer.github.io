Why are my notes still scattered everywhere?
---

I have two blogs. One of them for note taking. But there's no real structure.
I have OneNote. But I struggle between personal and company notes. 
I send emails to myself. It's mostly for articles I liked and would like to keep.


## GitHub / Generated website

Like
- The **safety** of a place that I know will be around in years. Github fits that bill nicely.
- From **anywhere**. Lowest common denominator - I can add something via a webpage, and know it'll get committed, safe, durable. No concept of "local"
- **Sharable** if needed 
- Markdown - simple format that forces clarity
- Ability to append / edit
- Ability to run scripts - promise of automation, or post-processing 

Dislike
- No proper search
- Images are a pain
- Locked to page format (I'm not diligent enough to always find the right page to add stuff to)
- No easy "share to" from phone

## Mail to self, or mail to wordpress server

Like
- Lowest common denominator - share to email usually available
- Email to wordpress creates a durable "trail"
- Potentially generates "pretty" representation (website generator)

Dislike
- Locked into wordpress


## File system on OneDrive

Like
- "Smart docs" folder that has the best of my writing / documents from work
    - A special "place", special decoration
- Nice for 


Dislike
- Some garbage accumulates

# OneNote

Like
- Support of many content types (images, web pages, youtube links)
- API support
- Search

Dislike
- requires too much consistency (structure degrades over time)
- adding is heavy operation
- over time looks ugly

# How to fix

- Creation of MD files created on github in sequential order
- all routing via hashtags (public / private)
- auto-generate source files for website generation (allows to leverage web search tech) - mkdocs or Pelican
- azure static web app as output

- auto-generate OneNote?

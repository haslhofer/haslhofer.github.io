2019 in Review 
---

When reflecting on a year, it's an interesting question of what comes back into focus, and what stays behind. What's worth mentioning or worth reflecting on? Is a year all about the big events, or the small ones that really made a difference? We've done a few of the big ones as a family in 2019 - time on the beach in Hawaii with Oma joining us; visiting family & friends in Austria during the winter holidays.

We checked one thing off my personal bucket list - an amazing motorcycle trip through Alaska and the Yukon on a BMW R1250 GS from Anchorage to Portland with Rachel in the summer; completing our vacation home in the mountains.

But what I've come to treasure most is how the little meaningful things are present in our lives: my time with Isabel when she practices the rhythms in her Cello practice with me and we're having a blast when she gets them right (or wrong). Me trail-running with Luca on the weekend and him being able to easily do a 5k (he truly has unlimited energy as long as we feed him three eggs in the morning, and snacks every other hour thereafter). Seeing Sophia during her violin recital play a hard piece so beautifully, determined, with such amazing dexterity.

Or when Luca surprises all of us with his unexpected math insights or things he remembers that just stun us. The little notes they sometimes write me, and I keep them in my little metal treasure box to remind me how truly special these years are. These precious moments keep accumulating.

I love the little snacks Rachel adds to my daily lunch-box she prepares for me every work day. I love opening them, knowing that she knows me; she knows the trivial things in my life, and the non-trivial ones. We have such a great life together - I treasure every day with her.    

We are a busy family.

Rachel seemingly has unlimited energy to give to our children and people around her. Her todo list is miles long, and everything gets done, always, with no exceptions. Her advocacy for our children is the most amazing thing to watch.  

My professional life at Microsoft has changed quite a bit in 2019 - I travel for business more than I ever have, with teams now in China, India, the US, and UK.

Running a geo-distributed team means early morning and late night calls, pretty much every day. I do love the diversity of talent I get to work with every day. I need to hire more engineers.  

I continue to marvel at the speed at which the tech industry innovates; how much progress there is in academia in areas I'm interested in (and how accessible these advances are as long as you have a PC and internet connection). And how much opportunity there is to create and invent. 

2019 has been a good year for us - each one of us has grown in so many ways, visited new places, made new friends. If you've read this far, thank you for catching up with the Haslhofer family!

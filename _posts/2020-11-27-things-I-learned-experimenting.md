- Taking a screenshot from Windows in the right resolution and scale factor
- Using Tesseract OCR engine
- spaCy NLP python library. [Demo with spacy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-named-entity-recognition-ner-using-spacy/)
- Powershell scripts and how to launch them (to access Windows.Media.OCR capabilities)
- Using Google cloud for [text classification](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dotnet-docs-samples/tree/master/language/api/Analyze)
- Creating a Flask webserver hosting python code to expose capabilities to a local c# app (instead of always launching the python exe given that's too slow)
- Authenticating using MSAL to access resources in MS Graph
- Adding pages to OneNote (including inline base64 encoded images embedded in HTML to avoid having to use multi-part messages which never worked)
- Creating c# structure based on Json payload. [source](https://json2csharp.com/)

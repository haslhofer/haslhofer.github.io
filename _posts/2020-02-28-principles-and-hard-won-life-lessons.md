Engineering Principles and other hard-won lessons 
---


# Leadership
*Some of these come from conversations with Ales Holecek*
- Rule #1 - [Prioritze](https://blog.usejournal.com/some-thoughts-on-ruthless-prioritization-b71277cb20b0)

- 3 strikes principle
    ```
    First month do what you need to do
    Second month mentoring and coaching
    Third month: it's dysfunctional, so needs to be fixed (e.g. leadership change) 
    ```


- Everything is matrixed. So you need leaders who can do product and technology
- Which metrics do we want to move? - customer or business focused
- Ruthlessly eliminate dysfunction
- Go plant your flag!
- Write down you principles
- Work is to achieve my mission

# Making decisions

Expected value decisions: P(success) x reward - cost of failure


# Running organizations
- Get the culture and people right
- 80% of investment needs to be in the direct service of the customer
- If I don't believe your plan you don't have a plan
- "What is the speed of light" of a problem
    ``` 
    What are the *actual physics*. Work back from there.
    ```

# Culture
- You can't have a cultural translation layer in the org (align culture at the top with culture in the middle with culture at the bottom)
    ```
    E.g. Concept of family vs. professional sports team 
    ```

# Organizational design

- Fix only dysfunctional orgs (because landing a new org take 6-9 months). Be steady-handed
- Experts across the full stack needed to create a product have to be *part of the team*
- Horizontal teams have the highest dysfunction (because they are disconnected from the customer)
- L-shaped orgs (platform + customer facing scenario) keep everyone humble


- Learning has to be part of the design because probability of getting things right the first time is so low
- Measure NPS consistently

# Project setup

## Dependencies
- A new product has to be dependency free, or only have dependencies that can be satisfied by providing a credit card (i.e. no people involved in getting a dependency commit)
- Cross-geo dependencies within team ~= cross-team dependencies (i.e. hard)

## Engineering methodologies
- Premortem - things that can wrong
    - Integrating two experiences - tight coupling between components drives down overall reliability
    - Catastrophic failure of scenario #1 does not lead to catastrophic failure of scenario #2


# Random life lessons
- It generally doesn't hurt to ask
- Life is about making the most of your circumstances
- Don't assume the future will be like the past. Play scenarios.
    - When ideating, choose 3 ideas to start with [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SemHh0n19LA)
- Don't put comfort ahead of success
- Managing my career is 100% my own responsibility
- It’s time to take a single self-confident leap rather than a series of incremental steps that don’t lead very far.
